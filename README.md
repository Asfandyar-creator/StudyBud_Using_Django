# Study Buddy

I developed Study Buddy, a web application using Django, that enables users to register, create study rooms, and collaborate with peers. The platform facilitates discussions, resource sharing, and group study sessions, enhancing learning experiences for students and professionals alike. Key features include user authentication, room creation, real-time chat, and file sharing capabilities. Study Buddy promotes interactive learning and community engagement in a seamless online environment.
